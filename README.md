#Android Game Demo

Hello fam,
here is the code we wrote together on April 1st. I've left it exactly as it was when the demo ended.


##Directions
If you would like me to explain something or add something (as long as it's not huge..) I'd be happy to do so. For that you will need to create an issue. If you're not sure what that is, that is ok; google "github issue" and you'll see how simple it is. Star this repo so that you will get notifications in the future as I change it.

That's it for now!

Best,
Pedram
